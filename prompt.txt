okay let's implement them, give me whole code, don't need any comments on the code or explanation for the codes, jsut give me the whole file.. and finally what git commit message should be as well, once i say let's move to next step or else if any bugs arises we'll solve that first, go one file at a time and i'll respond whether we can go to next file or not and then we can move to next file, if i need explanation i'll ask seperatly
